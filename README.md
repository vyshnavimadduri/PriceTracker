ðŸ›’ Amazon Price Tracker
This project is a Python-based Amazon Price Tracker that monitors the prices of selected products and sends real-time alerts when a price drop is detected. It combines web scraping with automation tools to keep users updated without manual checking.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Scrapes product data using BeautifulSoup and Requests for lightweight access.

Utilizes Selenium for dynamic content rendering on JavaScript-heavy pages.

Supports real-time notifications via email/SMS/console alerts when a price falls below a defined threshold.

Automatically refreshes and monitors product pages at scheduled intervals.

Designed for flexibility â€” easily configurable for different products or websites.

ðŸš€ How It Works
The user inputs the Amazon product URL and desired price threshold.

The tracker scrapes and parses the product's current price.

If the price drops below the specified amount, an alert is triggered.

The system continues to monitor in the background with periodic checks.
